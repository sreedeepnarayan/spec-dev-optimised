# AI Development Guide - Connected Banking Platform

## Subagent Strategy

### Core Philosophy
The Connected Banking Platform leverages AI agents for efficient, systematic development. This guide provides frameworks for using the Task tool effectively and maintaining high-quality code standards throughout the development lifecycle.

### Task Tool Usage Framework

#### When to Use Task Tool (MANDATORY)
1. **Multi-step Features** (3+ distinct operations)
2. **Cross-service Integration** (multiple microservices involved)
3. **Database Schema Changes** (models + migrations + API updates)
4. **Complete Feature Implementation** (backend + frontend + tests)
5. **User-provided Feature Lists** (comma-separated or numbered lists)
6. **Complex Bug Fixes** (investigation + fix + testing + documentation)

#### When NOT to Use Task Tool
1. **Single file edits** (simple configuration changes)
2. **Documentation updates** (README, comments)
3. **Trivial fixes** (typos, formatting)
4. **Simple questions** (code explanation, clarification)

## Context Management

### Session Initialization Protocol
```bash
# 1. Check current state
git status
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Verify system health
make health

# 3. Review project context
cat CLAUDE.md | head -50
cat specs/plan.md | grep -A 10 "Phase 1"

# 4. Check current tasks
cat specs/tasks.md | grep -E "\[ \]|ðŸ”„"
```

### Context Preservation Best Practices
1. **Always start** by reading CLAUDE.md and constitution.md
2. **Document decisions** immediately in relevant files
3. **Update progress** in task tracking files
4. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
5. **End sessions** with status updates

### Cross-Session Continuity
- **Before Starting**: Review last 5 git commits
- **During Work**: Maintain running TODO in comments
- **After Completion**: Update relevant documentation
- **Context Handoff**: Create clear status summaries
